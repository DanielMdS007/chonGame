Star Wars: Rogue Wars

Star Wars: Rogue Wars is a roguelike game built in the Chon Engine, where players embark on a mission to defeat stormtroopers and confront Darth Vader in an effort to bring an end to the Galactic War.
You can play as either Luke Skywalker or Han Solo:
Luke Skywalker is fast and wields a lightsaber to slice through enemies in close combat. However, he lacks the ability to fight at long range.
Han Solo uses his D-44 blaster to shoot enemies from afar. While effective at a distance, he moves more slowly and must reload his weapon.
